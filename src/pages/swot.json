              "result": "Having patents provides strong legal protection, creating barriers for competitors trying to replicate your product. It ensures your innovation is safeguarded, allowing you to capture market value without imitation. This competitive edge strengthens market position and attracts investors, as intellectual property is often a valuable business asset. Moreover, patents can offer leverage for licensing agreements, royalty payments, or strategic partnerships, enabling additional revenue streams."

This can lead to price wars, reduced profitability, and diminished brand value. To mitigate this risk, consider other protective measures such as trade secrets, rapid innovation cycles, or developing a unique customer experience. If your product is highly innovative, exploring patent registration may still be a worthwhile investment."
